# Four!

Jhin Bot is a Discord bot which scrapes op.gg for League of Legends champion statistics and displays them via Discord.py and BeautifulSoup. 


### Top Champions Per Role

A user can see the current top champions for the role of their choosing using the command `4!best-champs [role] ['5', '10', 'all']`.
